write central db at every click, refresh at every click
on my own page, need to be able to reserve every Tuesday 11:30-14:30 between September and November
full floorplan, minimap widget for roomselection, coffee-radius, printer

type[r/p](room/person)_hexID[00-ff]_weekno[1-53].wek

//we need reserved codes for:
  - ferien (room, pers)
  - urlaub (pers)
  - Home Office (oder default?)

Either Auth0 or MSAL (microsoft sso)

delegate booking
more refined filtering, also HO oder hier
konfi 15mins, flexbüros halbestag, ganztag 
avabrooms, not just in roomplan view
rechtmanagement (by category of room or sth)
white/blacklist rooms
lieblingsplatz(e)
pro sitzplatz

alias should be globally selectable (so if I book multiple weeks and rooms
I dont have to keep selecting the person Im booking for)

at selection (especially for personWeek mode or prolly exclusively)
there should be either a selector as roomWeek aliases and if thats set then good
but if thats not set then the program should just prompt after saving a selection
(so it sets those quarterhours as reserved in the meantime) with an autofilly 
textinput to chose what room to book (that autofilly thing has to be interfaced with
favorites and it should also have an endpoint at the DB so it can quickly querry for open slots)

Prolly youll have to keep track of a bit of a history, as you controll navigation and all
